# Apollo Server and Code Generator Example

This example shows how to set up the ["batteries-included" Apollo Server](link) using types generated by the [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/).

## How to use the types generated by Code Generator

Order of operations:

- Setup `codegen.yml` and specify the [plugins](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/plugins) you will be using.
  - In this examples we wanted types for our schema and resolvers so we added `typscript` and `typescript-resolvers`

<!-- TODO do we need typescript-operations??? -->
<!-- - It says you use these to create types based off Schema types??? -->
